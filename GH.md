## THE GARDEN AND THE HEDGE

The Garden and The Hedge is Kulturhus Björkboda’s (KUBU) inaugural international summer exhibition and programme, developed in partnership with the artist and researcher Teresa Dillon. Set in a former school, KUBU’s location on the island of Kimitoön, in the Southwest of Finland, in the UNESCO Archipelago Sea Biosphere Reserve, is the perfect location for exploring our relations to gardens, earth, soil and land.

While gardens have long symbolised ideals of paradise, power, and control, hedges, or the (pensas)aita, in Finnish or the häck in Swedish imply partition and boundaries. Yet for many, our relationship with the land is not a separation, but a symbiotic and reciprocal, call-and-response that requires care, stewardship and attention. Given that care of soil is all the more important given recent estimates of its global degradation.

Soil, as the primary substrate for life, is our collective concern. KUBU’s inaugural summer programme The Garden and The Hedge seeks to collectively explore the position of soil, in our collective imaginaries and responsibilities.

Marking the first in a series of interrelated programmes that take the elements (soil, water, wind, fire and aether), as their starting point, The Garden and The Hedge is timed with Kimitoön’s 700th anniversary. Drawing on the island’s rich history of soil-based livelihoods—from farming to mining. The summer programme showcases 35 individual art works, performances,  workshops and interventions. Inviting reflection on soil health, boundaries, resilience, and our responsibilities to the living land.

Les fleurs Du Mal/Flowers of Evil  
**Andy Best-Dunkley (FI/UK) & Merja Puustinen (FI)**  
*Inflatable Sculpture (2022)*

What form will plants take if their genetic structure has changed because of exposure to soil contamination, radioactive radiation, pollution and human population overload and artificial changes to the natural environment? Clambering and climbing over the roof and sides of the Kubu building, Merja Puustinen & Andy Best’s large inflatable sculpture, draws on poisonous plant formation, arrangement and aesthetics, the French poet Charles Baudelaire’s collection Les fleurs Du Mal (Flowers of Evil, 1857), Freudian dream logic, death visions and streams of consciousness, to create a speculative and potentially prophetic vision of future plant morphology.  
   
Andy Best-Dunkley and Merja Puustinen are an Espoo-based artist duo whose transdisciplinary media practice spans over three decades of collaborative works, ranging from early Internet art, there lead the field in creating 3D online words, and used game and mobile platforms to create works that tackle social and political themes in playful, provocative and physical ways. Combining sculpture, performance and installation, since the mid-2000s they have been creating large-scale interventions that take the form of inflatable sculptures for museums and urban spaces. In 2012, the duo founded Espoo Kunsthalle, an initiative to bring critically engaged art to suburban areas and are currently running an artistic residency to investigate the environmental challenges facing the Baltic Sea. Best-Dunkley leads on sculpture teaching and development within the Centre for General Studies, Aalto School of Arts, Design and Architecture.

### Forest Square I, II & III

**Antti Laitinen (FI)**  
*C-print, Diasec (2023)*

In *Forest Square I, II & III*, Finnish artist Antti Laitinen physically removes a 10 x 10 meter section of forest, extracting its various elements—soil, moss, wood, and pines. These messy, natural components are deconstructed and reassembled into geometric forms that evoke the Cubist rejection of nature as mere representation, instead emphasising how abstraction can offer view multiple perspectives. The work also alludes to the Dutch De Stijl movement, where pure abstraction and restrained palettes were an attempt to transcend cultural divisions by reflecting how simplified forms could articulate the underlying mystical and spiritual order of the visible world.

Viewing the landscape as his primary canvas, since the early 2000s, Finnish artist Antti Laitinen has worked with and through the natural elements. Armed with everyday tools—ranging from garden implements to wood-cutting instruments—Laitinen physically shapes, bends, digs, organizes, and rearranges trees, soil, and water. These deliberate insertions delve into the intricate dynamics of control that define the relationship between humans and nature that result in highly graphic photographic images, durational performances, and video pieces.

In the Skin of a meadow is a series of bespoke prints, created by the artist Constanza Dessain as she developed a wildflower meadow in her homeplace in the south of Scotland. As piles of weeds, dock, sticky willie and ragwort are pulled in midsummer before they go to seed. The terminology itself is uneasy as ‘invasive species are removed to benefit ‘native flora’. Their vegetative bodies are thrown over one another, tendrils lie over tendons in knots that are lifted and dumped along the plot’s margin. Transformed into prints, the plants release an image of themselves as their sap bleeds into the light sensitive chemicals. Both on the page and at the meadow, creation is dependent on the form of some things being undone.

Visual artist Constanza Dessain takes the shape and morphology of landscapes to create improvised prints that reflect on ecological entanglement, and practices of landscape repair and the flux of place. A senior tutor at the Royal Drawing School, London, she currently lives and works in rural Scotland, where she is carrying out practice-based research on the interplay of touch and time in imprints made with the substances of early photography at the School of Arts, at the University of West England, Bristol.

### *Garden of the Undocumented*

**Kalle Hamm (FI) & Dzamil Kamanger, Iran/Finland**  
*Pot garden, book and drawings (2013)*  
   
The Finnish Food Safety Authority requires a phytosanitary certificate akin to a health certificate for all seedlings, pot plants, certain cut flowers, seeds and vegetables when they are imported to Finland from outside the EU. The certificate assesses the biosecurity risk of the plant, by focusing on whether it is carrying pests or diseases. On import, the certificate must be presented upon import, and the plant inspector must be informed of the import.   
   
Cut flowers are often exempt from requiring a phytosanitary certificate because they are considered low-risk plant products, as they are considered as no longer pose a significant biosecurity risk. Beyond such risks, cut flowers signify something special, with their aesthetic value and presentation, often used to mark an occasion or event. In Finland, up to twenty cut flowers are allowed ‘in’ without questions. Drawing an analogy to how Immigration Service requires appropriate documents from persons entering the country, including how staying without proper authorization, is referred to as the undocumented.  
   
*Garden of the Undocumented (2013) shares the stories of fourteen plants whose native soils lie outside of the EU.* Imagining the story of each plant from a first-person position, the selected plants include a mix of those imported from areas where they are native and some of them have been introduced to Finland, by humans. Each plant story acts as a metaphor not just for undocumented immigrants but also speaks to how humans control access, privileging those with perceived high value, specialist skills, connections or wealth, as acceptable, over others who are not.

Having originally met when they were working in a Helsinki pizzeria, **Kalle Hamm** & **Dzamil Kamanger** have been working together since 1999, with their work addressing multiculturalism through the global and interrelated movement of plants, goods and people. In keeping with contemporary posthuman perspectives, that destabilize human-only, anthrop- and zoocentric certitude, Hamm and Kamanger’s longstanding exploration on the topic of gardens and the everyday lives of plants, nods to what the philosopher Michael Marder has referred to as plant-thinking and vegetal mindfulness, with the artists viewing plants as active, conscious agents in their environments.

*Removing Defences* is the documentation of live act, where defensive hairs of the nettle are removed. Artists also recorded the sounds of the nettle during the operation. 

The audio recorders were connected to the nettle with stereo cable. Liquids with a certain electrical charge are running inside the stem of the nettle, and the changes of the electric conductivity can be measured by a voltmeter and these changes can be converted audible for the human ear. Video is questioning the idea of plants being mute and senseless beings without feelings.

In 2015, Hamm & Kamanger conceptually founded the sound collective Band of Weeds with ‘band’ members featuring different plants, alongside humans Lauri Ainala, Hermanni Keko and Anniina Saksa. Working with the Soviet botanist Ivan Gunar, plants perform in the band, through the sonic transposition of the ionised liquids that run inside of plant tissues and the associated changes in their electro-magnetic field, which are converted into sounds that humans can hear.   
   
Copies of Band of Weeds LP, “Other Than Human” (2017), and the EP “Waiting for Extinction” (2019), will be available in the gallery to listen on headphones.

### By the Code of Soil

**Kasia Molga (UK/PL) & Scanner (UK)**  
*Video documentation, Full-HD, 9’56 (2018)*  
   
*By the Code of Soil* (2018) took the form of an online networked digital artwork, mobile app and sensing network through which audiences could experience the vibrant matters of soil through a uniquely data-driven generated audio-visual representation that was activated on people’s laptop or desktop computer for a fixed duration in 2019.   
   
The project emerged from the GROW Observatory programme (2016-19), a European citizen science project, that used low-cost soil sensors to collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and light levels, empowering communities to monitor their soils and contribute to environmental research, particularly validating satellite data. As part of this project, digital artist Kasia Molga and the British electronic musician, Robin Rimbaud aka Scanner drew on the soil data captured from the moisture sensors, as well as too the flight path of the European Space Agency’s flagship satellite, Sentinel-1A, which passes overhead twice a day and captures data such as forestry, agriculture and weather conditions to support climate prediction modelling. As the satellite passed overhead audiences’ location, the artwork appeared on their computer screens. As it was based on data that was constantly generated, the graphic and sonic form the artwork took on the screen changed each time.   
   
The video work presented in the Kubu gallery, is a speculative audio-visual and spoken word narrative. An artifact of the wider project that considers what it means to speak on behalf of soil.

**Kasia Molga**   
Working with environmental and biological data, ![Kasia Molga](http://www.kasiamolga.net/) creates multisensory interactive and immersive situations, performances and audio-visual animations, that reflect on what we mean by “nature” and our relationship with it. Defining her position as that of a design fusionist, her work explores how as humans, we can speak with and on behalf of nature. In 2013, along with ![Erik Overmeire](http://www.lifthoofd.nl/) and ![Ivan Henriques](http://www.ivanhenriques.com/) she co-founded ![World Wilder Lab, a platform](http://worldwilderlab.net/) focusing on inter- and intra- species communication. ![World Wilder Lab](http://worldwilderlab.net/) aims to facilitate artistic expression for biological entities and natural systems. Prior to that she worked for several years with the collective Protei, a group of international artists, designers, engineers, scientists and sailors creating Open Hardware technology for the ocean.

*A temporary machine made of mud, sticks and recycled electronics, 2020-*   
   
*Mud Machine* (2020–ongoing) is a series of temporary machines crafted from mud, sticks, and recycled electronics by French Welsh artist Paul Granjon. Each Mud Machine takes on a unique form, shaped by the local soil conditions and in collaboration with others through the collection of regional materials and the dismantling of electronic waste (e-Waste). These machines are kinetic creations that embody Granjon’s long-standing interest in how playful, hands-on approaches to making can challenge our understanding of technological complexity. *Mud Machine* highlights the labour and effort required to replicate the very earth beneath our feet, shedding light on the materiality and energy that is often overlooked in our perceptions of technology.

**Paul Granjon’s** work explores the co-evolution of humans and machines through live performances, exhibitions, participative events and academic publications with his current practice focusing on creative low-technology, participation and ecology. Since the 1990s, his work has been exhibited extensively and in 2005, he represented Wales at the Venice Biennale 2005 and is known for his pedagogical and playful interventions and research into creative low-technology.

Electroculture is an experimental gardening technique that uses highly conductive metals like copper to absorb electricity from the air and the earth and transfer it back to plants. Drawing on some of the same principles as the engineer Nikola Tesla’s and other early radiographers used in their wireless energy transmission experiments. Coiled copper wire spirals act like an antenna by passively harvesting atmospheric electrical, which is transmitted back to the plants. This technique used to aim at promoting plant health and growth. In the early 1900s the French scientist Justin Christofleau (1925) published his findings on the technique, which brought wider attention to the technique, which is now used with varying degrees of success by gardeners and growers.   
   
Following electroculture designs, Magz Hall connects the practice to her long-standing exploration in radio art practices. To create a bespoke set of copper structures, whose design is influenced by radio transmitter coils. The coils will be used to support potted plants that will sit in the Kubu garden. Plants selected for this garden have been chosen for their pollution cleansing properties in partnership with Kubu’s founder and gardener Sari Kippilä. Alongside the garden, an 18th century etching of the electroculture designs will be on display in the gallery.  
   
Sound artist **Magz Hall** is known for her work in radio art, expanded radio and sculpture, wireless technology across the spectrum and podcasts. As a former director at the Community Media Association, she has successfully lobbied for community radio in the UK and was a founder of award-winning London arts station Resonance FM and is currently the Director of Community Media Association (CMA). In 2021, along with J Backhouse, Hall established Radio Arts and independent artists’ group who promote radio as a site for creative experimentation. From 2006-2025 she held the post of Senior Lecturer in the School of Media Art and Design at Canterbury Christ Church University, where she was the course director of BA in Film, Radio and TV 2006-2025.

### ![Pulse](./pics/Pulse.gif “Pulse”) Photo: (Artist)

### Pulse

**Teemu Lehmusruusu (FI)**   
*Sonic Sculpture in glass, bronze, electronics (2023)*

Pulse is a sonically resonating bronze and glass sculpture, a human-soil probe tapping into its chosen environment’s ecosystemic agencies and prerequisites of bioactivity with the help of moisture and temperature sensors. In its ethos, the sculpture creates a site of resonance, attention to those fragile conditions of life that lie below our feet, which we usually do not understand as part of the idea of ‘landscape’. A landscape as volumes instead of surfaces, and sculpture as a possibility to open routes, places to stop, and situations to bodily encounter the dynamism of these volumes as a materially resonating, aesthetic experience.  
   
Designed to be site-sensitive and adaptable for indoor and outdoor settings, the sensorial sculpture transmits the soil’s temperature and moisture as sinusoids into the resonant material, the glass bowl. Each blown glass object is unique and produces distinct sounds. The mixed output of four pairs of sine wave generators drives the exciters. Each pair contains a fixed sine wave generator and a variable one. Initially, they begin in unison—that is, they share the same frequency—but as the soil's moisture and temperature level fluctuates, the variable sine wave generator, controlled by the sensors, slips out of unison with the fixed generator. This difference in frequency generates a beating, which is perceived as a periodic variation in volume: the drier the soil, the faster the beating. In extreme drought, the more soothing drone-like sounds turn into a type of stress signal, while in completely flooded soil, the beating becomes flat, like a vanishing heart rate.

**Teemu Lehmusruusu** is an artist based in Helsinki and Kemiönsaari, Finland. His practice is based on long-term dialogue and field engagement with regenerative farmers and soil and climate researchers, through which he seeks to foster a more multimodal and sensorial relationship with soil phenomena, especially in agriculture and forestry. By rattling the concepts of landscape and the framings of our perception, the research explores ways of belonging in the multispecies environment. Teemu is currently a doctoral researcher at the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture and a member of the Puistokatu 4 research community.

*Rasberry Pi Computer, Open Source software Shareboxx, Router, Mini-Display Screen, custom software. Video documentation, Full-HD, 5’21”. Wall print, furniture built from recycled wood. Build and Install: From 15-18th July as permanent library*  
   
Located on the Croatian island of Vis, ISSA - The Island School for Social Autonomy is an experimental school that aims to cultivate ways of living, learning, and teaching together, as well as prototype how to live a "good life" in the age of extinction.  The school's approach is rooted in social autonomy, a political strategy and model for social organization that emphasises the ability of individuals to function as cooperative group members, making autonomous decisions through mechanisms of collective deliberation.   
   
The focus on collective deliberation and what it means, to practice how to live together, complements the underlying values and approach that sits at the heart of Kubu. With ISSA and Kubu located in rural, island contexts the question of how such work is activated in spaces and places that sit outside the heightened potentiality of urban densities creates further common ground. 

As part of our summer residency !Mediengruppe Bitnik will build on the foundations of the ISSA digital library that was created in 2024, which was set up to store "how to" pamphlets, texts and other materials including shadow libraries such as UbuWeb. This will be achieved through a three-day open access workshop, where participants can sign-up for free, drop-in sessions in which they’ll learn the processes behind setting up the library.   
   
!Mediengruppe Bitnik is the collective name for the artist duo Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smcreates. Since the early 2000s they have been creating contemporary art works on and with the Internet that expand into physical spaces, through the manipulation of physical objects and artefacts.

One-to-one concert  
**Antti Tolvi (FI)**  
part of Future ballet 700 Kimitoön

All our senses are ultimately based on our sense of touch. The sense of touch is the first to which life has begun to sense its surroundings. The body has slowly cultivated this sensation, e.g. sense of smell (we feel odor molecules in our nostrils), taste (we feel things in our mouth), hearing (we feel the vibration of the air/earth), sight (we feel amount of photons and their wavelength) etc. We even experience our emotions physically in our body. In other words, we are driven just by sence of different touchs.

In this minimal One-to-one concert, composer/sound artist Antti Tolvi plays this holistic instrument, e.g. with sounds, tastes, colors, qualitys, movements of air, timbre, touch and thoughts. Duration, 5-10 minutes.

Antti Tolvi s a sound artist and performer from Turku/Kemiönsaari. Antti has been one of the most significant figures in the field of experimental music in Finland since 2002. Antti has performed on three continents and has released 14 solo albums. In 2016-2025, Antti has held over 20 solo exhibitions and participated in several group exhibitions. Works have been exhibited at, among others, Sibelius Museum Turku (2023), Flow Festival HKI (2013, 2014, 2018, 2022), Rovaniemi Art Museum (2022), Helsinki Festival (2021), Musica Nova Festival (2021), Helsinki Biennale (Teemu Lehmusruusu working group 2021), Pori Art Museum (2020).

### Love The Poo

Drop in and pick up on the 10th June, a valuable local produce, horse manure! Why is horse manure so good for gardens? Well it is an extremely good soil improver. Combined with stable bedding, such as hay, grasses or wood shavings or wood pulp, when it rots down it can be used as a mulch. But be warned! Fresh manure must not be directly used, as it can actually remove nutrients and scorch plants, the manure needs to rot down. To do this, add it to compost heaps or mix with a bedding material. The time it takes to rot down depends on the maturity of your compost heap and the bedding material used.

Thur 19 Jun 11.00-13.00  
Saunavihta  
**Local Wizard**

In this workshop, you will learn the very basics of making a sauna whisk (in Finnish "vasta" or "vihta"). Tying birch branches into a bouquet doesn't sound complicated, but there are a lot of regional or personal idiosyncracies to it: When and how to pick the branches, if there are other tree species in the mix, how you ley the leaves, how and with what materials you tie it together and how you should use and store it. A well made whisk can be dried for the winter and will keep the form even after multiple uses. Every village in Finland has still a person who has this knowledge and skills in use. You will meet the one near us.

Thurs 19 June 14.00-17.00

### Bloom Workshop

**Aino El Solh (FI)**  
   
Tuning into the summer solstice frequencies and the midsummer bloom of plants, this workshop connects Finnish folk tales, with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and plants reproductive systems. Drawing on the old Finnish custom, where seven different flowers from a meadow are collected on a nightless night and placed under your pillow, so as to vision/dream your future spouse. Participants will gather wild and meadow plants from around the Kubu site, exploring their structures through microscopes, collective discussion, observations and meditations on plant reproduction, will be explored through a mix of printing and painting, and peer-to-peer learning. 

Visual artist and acupuncture practitioner, **Aino El Sol** work addresses the efforts and temporal dimensions of everyday care relations through collective enterprises and configurations. This has manifested in a variety of visual, performance and built environment projects, including the transformation of abandoned spaces into habitable, cultural venues (De Fabriek, Rotterdam), the establishment of hospitality accommodation for independent artists and cultural works (Mrs Blacks, Berlin) and the development of a self-sustaining, eco-village in Lebanon. She is a member of the Berlin-based, interdisciplinary group of international artists and cultural producer, MATERIAL FANTASIES, whose autobiographical work and lived experiences inform their work on contemporary feminist positions addressing motherhood(s) in the arts. In 2021, on graduating from the Heilpraktikschule in Selbstverwaltung (HPS), Berlin, El Sol opened her acupuncture clinic in Helsinki.

### KUBU Community Greenhouse

**Local Participants with Jussi Puustjärvi**  
   
Over several months, we have been co-designing and co-constructing the KUBU Community Greenhouse. Learning how to design, set up and build a greenhouse from recycled materials under the guidance of a local carpenter Jussi Puustjärvi. The structure utilises old windows, bricks and other recycled materials. In Spring 2025, a prototype greenhouse will be built in the KUBU yard during the spring, with the aim to provide people with the skills to build their own greenhouse. The participants may use the KUBU greenhouse and a communal harvest celebration will be organized at the end of the summer program. The workshop series is part of the program for the 700th anniversary of Kemiönsaari and launches the first part of an ongoing series of outdoor facilities that will be designed for the KUBU site and local communities. 

The KUBU community greenhouse will be constructed under the supervision of local carpenter Jussi Puustärvi. The design phase attracted a dozen locals from various professions.

### Plant Dyes and Natural Inks, Part 1 & 2

**Ronja Tammenpää & Marjut Nordberg**

Plant dyes and natural inks is a two workshop (Part 1, Sat 12 July and Part 2, Sun 13 July), where you will immerse yourself in the world of colors obtained from plants. The workshop will teach you the basics of plant dyes, eco-printing on canvas with natural plants, and the production of plant inks and raw watercolors. Participants will have the opportunity to collect natural plants from the local area, experiment with raw watercolors found in the kitchen, and create their own plant-based paintings with homemade reed pens. Bring your writing instruments and, if you wish, your own natural light fabric (cotton, linen, silk, wool) for eco-printing.

**Ronja Tammenpää** is a Creative Sustainability Master of Arts student at Aalto University in Espoo. In summer 2024 she explored making inks and pigments out of wild plants at the university BioMakerStudio creating her own plant colour library. The artist is generally interested in creating daily use objects, such as arts supplies, using foraged natural resources. In her work plants are not materials but active collaboration partners with their own personalities and needs.

**Marjut Nordberg** is an Art and Creative Expression and Crafts teacher at the Finnish Diaconal College. Her teaching subjects also include promoting sustainable development, and therefore recycled and natural materials are a central part of all teaching. She is interested in dyeing with plants, eco-printing and experimenting with natural, non-toxic dyes as a possible alternative to plastic and chemical-based dyes/colorants. Making art can be a process that simultaneously strengthens the connection to nature and the knowledge of the surrounding nature for all involved.

### Island School for Social Autonomy (ISSA) Library Extension

**Drop-In workshop with !Mediengruppe Bitnik**  
   
Located on the Croatian island of Vis, ISSA - The Island School for Social Autonomy is an experimental school that aims to cultivate ways of living, learning, and teaching together, as well as prototype how to live a "good life" in the age of extinction.  The school's approach is rooted in social autonomy, a political strategy and model for social organization that emphasises the ability of individuals to function as cooperative group members, making autonomous decisions through mechanisms of collective deliberation.   
   
As part of our summer residency !Mediengruppe Bitnik will build on the foundations of the ISSA digital library that was created in 2024, which was set up to store "how to" pamphlets, texts and other materials including shadow libraries such as UbuWeb. This will be achieved through a three-day open access workshop, where participants can sign-up for free, drop-in sessions in which they’ll learn the processes behind setting up the library. 

**!Mediengruppe Bitnik** is the collective name for the artist duo Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smcreates. Since the early 2000s they have been creating contemporary art works on and with the Internet that expand into physical spaces, through the manipulation of physical objects and artefacts.

### Manure Worm VJ Clew

**Andrew Gryf Patterson & Eisenia Fetida**

Vee-jaying (VJ) derives from the term disc-jockey (DJ), whereby two or more visual samples or inputs are mixed together to create a single, fluid image. Drawing on this practice,   
Paterson will create a prototype VJ system that visually reveals hidden processes of the Eisenia Fetida crew. The system will include the creation of a specially constructed bin equipped with infra-red or night-vision lighting to minimize disruption to the worms, while capturing their activity among the compost materials and other organisms. Using microcontroller(s) and mini-projector setup, the system can switch between viewing angles, apply real-time visual filters, integrate with open-source VJ software, to create dynamic, interactive projections. This system will be built during  Gryf Patterson residency at KUBU, with outcomes demonstrated as a programme partnership with the Norpas Festival.

**Andrew Paterson** is a self-styled 'artist-organiser', cultural producer, educator, archivist and interdependent researcher. Originally from Scotland, but active in Helsinki, Finland, as well as Latvia, the Eastern Baltic Sea region and beyond. They pursue a participatory hybrid arts practice through workshops, performative events & storytelling; Association member of Pixelache and Bioart Society. Since 2016, Andrew has been composting and cooperating with Eisenia Fetida. 

**Eisenia Fetida** or commonly in English as ‘manure worms’, ‘redworms’ and ‘red wigglers’ are ringed-segment earthworms that have adapted to live and survive in decaying organic material, rotting vegetation, and manure. Commonly used in domestic and industrial vermicomposting to break down organic matter. In English the name for a collection of worms is 'clew', which Paterson transforms into “crew”. This play on words alluding to Vee-Jaying (VJ) and Disc-Jockey (DJ) scenes, where groups of people aka crews, tend to work together to create the club night or disco.

**Sensory-Microbial-Vegetal Meshworks Workshop Series** 

Join researchers, educators and microbial advocates from CSSM, Faidon Papadakis, Will LaFleur, Maya Hey and collaborator Eline Tabak for a series of workshops that will run over August and form part of our closing weekend wrap up. The interrelated series of workshops will weave common concerns and tactics for living with soils, microbes, plants, and our interdependencies. Through practices of home-brewing, Sensory-Microbial-Vegetal Meshworks closes our programme by deeply connecting to our lively entanglements of soil and its importance for the future of our planet. 

**The Centre for the Social Study of Microbes (CSSM**) at the University of Helsinki. An international hub for social scientists and artists conducting research on human-microbial relations, CSSM aims to develop theory and methods to better make sense of the complex relations between humans, nonhumans, microbes, and their environments. As noted on the centre's site, there has been a boom of microbiome research since the early 2000s. Microbes are vastly more abundant in the environment and inside our bodies than previously thought. With microbe deficits now associated with everything from mental health to autoimmune diseases. There is also increasing awareness of microbes’ vital role in different ecosystems and ecological relations to the extent that global warming, soil depletion, and biodiversity loss are associated with imbalanced microbial ecologies.

### Soil-making and the Grid of the Atlas: Histories and Imaginings of a Queer Trans Socialist Herbalism

   
**Miha brebenel** is a Bucharest-born white queertrans based in London. Their long-term and expanding explorations are focused on the histories of internationalism and solidarity, intersections with disability, gender, critical plant studies, law, social and healing justice. They are a senior lecturer in Digital Cultures at Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton where they currently convene the MSc in Creative Technologies.   
   
**Performance Lecture:** This performance lecture takes researcher miha brebenael’s work on ‘socialist herbalism’, or the histories of herbalism in historically socialist spaces in the Baltic region, the Balkans and in Eastern Europe, as its starting point. The work builds on several historical materials published by the U.S.S.R. and the Socialist Republic of Romania, in the form of Atlases and collections of maps. The focus is on soil taxonomies, specifically working through the imagination of the soil category of the “chernozem” as a particular type of very rich soil and resource. This history is met by a queerfeminist method and creative practice with collaged images from educational materials found in the self-organised Residency and Project Space MASSIA (massia.ee) situated in rural Estonia, where miha has organised Socialist Herbalism Gatherings for the past two years. Post the performance lecture there will be a Q&A with *The Garden and The Hedge*’s artistic lead Teresa Dillon.
