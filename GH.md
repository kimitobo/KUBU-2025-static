# THE GARDEN AND THE HEDGE

## THE GARDEN AND THE HEDGE

The Garden and The Hedge is Kulturhus Björkboda’s (KUBU) inaugural international summer exhibition and programme, developed in partnership with the artist and researcher Teresa Dillon. Set in a former school, KUBU’s location on the island of Kimitoön, in the Southwest of Finland, in the UNESCO Archipelago Sea Biosphere Reserve, is the perfect location for exploring our relations to gardens, earth, soil and land.

While gardens have long symbolised ideals of paradise, power, and control, hedges, or the (pensas)aita, in Finnish or the häck in Swedish imply partition and boundaries. Yet for many, our relationship with the land is not a separation, but a symbiotic and reciprocal, call-and-response that requires care, stewardship and attention. Given that care of soil is all the more important given recent estimates of its global degradation.

Soil, as the primary substrate for life, is our collective concern. KUBU’s inaugural summer programme The Garden and The Hedge seeks to collectively explore the position of soil, in our collective imaginaries and responsibilities.

Marking the first in a series of interrelated programmes that take the elements (soil, water, wind, fire and aether), as their starting point, The Garden and The Hedge is timed with Kimitoön’s 700th anniversary. Drawing on the island’s rich history of soil-based livelihoods—from farming to mining. The summer programme showcases 35 individual art works, performances,  workshops and interventions. Inviting reflection on soil health, boundaries, resilience, and our responsibilities to the living land.

*Inflatable Sculpture*  
What form will plants take if their genetic structure has changed because of exposure to soil contamination, radioactive radiation, pollution and human population overload and artificial changes to the natural environment? Clambering and climbing over the roof and sides of the Kubu building, Merja Puustinen & Andy Best’s large inflatable sculpture, draws on poisonous plant formation, arrangement and aesthetics, the French poet Charles Baudelaire’s collection Les fleurs Du Mal (Flowers of Evil, 1857), Freudian dream logic, death visions and streams of consciousness, to create a speculative and potentially prophetic vision of future plant morphology.  
   
**Andy Best-Dunkley (FI/UK) & Merja Puustinen (FI)**   
Andy Best-Dunkley and Merja Puustinen are an Espoo-based artist duo whose transdisciplinary media practice spans over three decades of collaborative works, ranging from early Internet art, there lead the field in creating 3D online words, and used game and mobile platforms to create works that tackle social and political themes in playful, provocative and physical ways. Combining sculpture, performance and installation, since the mid-2000s they have been creating large-scale interventions that take the form of inflatable sculptures for museums and urban spaces. In 2012, the duo founded Espoo Kunsthalle, an initiative to bring critically engaged art to suburban areas and are currently running an artistic residency to investigate the environmental challenges facing the Baltic Sea. Best-Dunkley leads on sculpture teaching and development within the Centre for General Studies, Aalto School of Arts, Design and Architecture.

**Antti Laitinen (FI)**  
Viewing the landscape as his primary canvas, since the early 2000s, Finnish artist Antti Laitinen has worked with and through the natural elements. Armed with everyday tools—ranging from garden implements to wood-cutting instruments—Laitinen physically shapes, bends, digs, organizes, and rearranges trees, soil, and water. These deliberate insertions delve into the intricate dynamics of control that define the relationship between humans and nature that result in highly graphic photographic images, durational performances, and video pieces.

In *Forest Square II & III*, Finnish artist Antti Laitinen physically removes a 10 x 10 meter section of forest, extracting its various elements—soil, moss, wood, and pines. These messy, natural components are deconstructed and reassembled into geometric forms that evoke the Cubist rejection of nature as mere representation, instead emphasising how abstraction can offer view multiple perspectives. The work also alludes to the Dutch De Stijl movement, where pure abstraction and restrained palettes were an attempt to transcend cultural divisions by reflecting how simplified forms could articulate the underlying mystical and spiritual order of the visible world.

## SUMMER RESIDENCIES 

*The Garden and The Hedge,* marks the initiation of a more comprehensive residency programme for KUBU. Over the twelve week summer programme, our residents stay and live on site, creating new work or building on existing projects that will be shared during the programme.
